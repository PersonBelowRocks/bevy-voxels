## mip-texture-array

This is a crate for working with array textures and mipmaps of these array textures. It's specialized for the voxel engine but can work elsewhere too. It requires all images in the texture array to be square and the same dimensions.

A lot of code here is heavily based on [bevy_tile_atlas](https://github.com/MrGVSV/bevy_tile_atlas/tree/main) by [MrGVSV](https://github.com/MrGVSV). That crate also has some good quality code that was nice to read to get an understanding of how to work with images in Bevy.
